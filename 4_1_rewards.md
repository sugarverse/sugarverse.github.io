# Rewards system

Each new planet is hosting a new game. However, older planets experience diminishing returns and the gCNDY rewards from the game on older planets are lowered by a factor of 10%. For example, when the 4th planet is ready with its game for the public, the rewards on the 3rd planet decrease by 10%, the rewards on the 2nd planet decrease by 20% and the rewards on the 1st planet decrease by 30%.
