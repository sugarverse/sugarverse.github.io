Who doesnâ€™t like a good old pinatas full of tasty treats? Inside the Sugarverse, players can discover pinata or simply purchase them with their CNDY tokens.

Boxes contain different awards, such as boosters and cosmetics. Depending on the box rarity level (3 levels overall), the loot inside it gets more precious as the box gets more expensive. The boxes work on a random principle, so even the cheapest boxes can drop the most lucrative prizes, but the chances are much lower.
