## Old vs New gaming economy

Traditionally gaming has always been a one-sided relationship, where the developers or owners of a game get the financial gains, while players are not financially rewarded. The perception about games was that they were just a way of having fun.

However, a new economic model has emerged, which rewards players in exchange for their time spent on playing the game, it is called play-to-earn. This model has become incredibly popular in the Web 3.0 vision.

Web3 gaming is one of the most exciting areas within the ever-growing crypto space. The global web3 games market size is projected to reach USD 3618.4 million by 2028, from USD 755 million in 2021. The web3 gaming model embraces the idea of an open economy and financially rewards every user who adds value by playing and spending time in the gaming ecosystem. With the emergence of this model games are no longer “just for fun” and now are perceived as investment opportunities.

In recent times, the industry has seen big venture capital firms invest heavily into the sector. Even though web3 games are only just emerging, the evidence suggests that players are much more engaged and the overall player satisfaction has been increased, leading to a boost in popularity over the longer term for game developers.

A clear trend had been established that supported the dynamics of an online community. By adding the ability to generate a financial income, web3 games are making the game and their communities a lot more active. The niche is still young, so it might be beneficial to keep an eye on these play-and-earn projects, as they can be beneficial in the long run
