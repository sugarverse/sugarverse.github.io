The team behind Sugarverse has previously developed 10 mobile games, published in 30+ languages, and attracted over 60 million players worldwide since 2005. The team is highly experienced and passionate about delivering the ultimate metaverse experience available on the market.

## What is the Sugarverse?

Our vision is to offer a candy themed meta universe that consists of seven planets and seven integrated games. Our unique Play-And-Earn approach creates a cyclical economy and solves the biggest issue with P2E - broken economy.

As a player you can own land, build buildings, and collect rewards in the form of (Non-Fungible Tokens, aka NFTs) and/or CNDY tokens. You can play on each planet a unique Play-to-earn mobile game which is developed in house or published on our platform together with a partner gaming studio. Our focus is on developing the highest quality casual mobile games to appeal to both crypto and non-crypto game enthusiasts - removing the barriers to entry for new crypto gamers.

Our aim is to disrupt the market by providing a true gaming experience within our metaverse. Fully benefiting from the accelerated adoption of blockchain gaming, meanwhile providing a distribution platform for gaming studios to work with.
Sugarverse is a metaverse that is truly owned by our users - all assets in the game are represented as NFTs - non-fungible tokens and can be exported and traded on open markets. The in-game transactions are all recorded on the blockchain to ensure that there is no centralized party that could tamper the game results.

We issue a native token, CNDY, as the governance token as well as the necessary currency for the gameplay and trade on the marketplace. Itâ€™s the default currency in the Sugarverse world. We also have an in-game points gCNDY, earned by playing the games and can be exchanged for CNDY token on our marketplace.

## Game structure

Players can explore our games in single player mode, which would allow them to earn gCNDY and NFT rewards and advance their characters. This game mode will have limited daily gameplay in the form of lives and has a daily cap on the rewards earned, encouraging returning players.
Multiplayer is something we are incredibly focused on as a team as this provides players with the engagement necessary to advance in the development of the metaverse. This unique mode pairs 3 players against each other and has a certain gCNDY buy-in (different for each lobby).  At the start of the match, the 3 players are faced with a mechanic which chooses a random juicy reward they will be competing for.

Some reward examples are:

- Up to x1000 multiplier
- Unique NFTs only obtainable in Multiplayer
- Cosmetics for their characters

Both single and multiplayer presents different terrains and maps to the player as well as tasks and achievements to conquer rewarding the players for every move they make within our metaverse.

## Guilds

The Sugarverse is designed to be a social place. So we are delighted to welcome our players to interact with others as much as possible and to create or join guilds, which leads to even greater rewards shared across the members.
