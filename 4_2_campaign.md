# Rumble mode

Rumble Mode is a PvP (Player vs Player) mode designed for players who do not wish to engage in PvP or want to grind experience, NFTs, and gCNDY token rewards. The adventures a player can experience are improving player skills, giving players huge engagement.

Lobbies become more expensive and offer better rewards.. In Rumble Mode, players do not need to invest any money to play the games; the only thing they need to commit to is time and effort. The game design is such that players with any skill level can earn rewards, not just the paying % of gamers.
