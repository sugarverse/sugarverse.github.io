# Play-to-Earn games

With a total of 5 games in our pipeline, all will belong to the new gaming economy – the ”Play-and-Earn” model. Winning is based on players own skill and strategy, not luck. Players in Sugarverse are rewarded for their time, efforts, and skills in the game. This concept gives players ownership rights over all in-game items and incentivises them to play and progress through the game.
