# Sugar metaverse elements and NFTs

The Sugarverse is a planetary galaxy made up of seven planets â€“ combined they form our metaverse. Each planet is broken down to blockchain backed land parcels. This land can be bought and sold by players, however, land can be used to build buildings which deliver a steady return depending on their tier. Each planet also comes with a unique Play-to-earn game to ensure a constant player reward stream from our metaverse.

The Sugarverse is connected by intense plot, which offers a whole new experience to the metaverse.
